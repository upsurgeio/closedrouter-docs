Pineapple uses **Bearer tokens** for authentication.\
You can manage and create your API keys in the Pineapple dashboard.

<Warning>
  Pineapple API keys are powerful: they can be used to track usage, set credit limits, or integrate with OAuth flows. Always store keys securely - never commit them to public repos. 
</Warning>

### Using an API Key

If calling Pineapple API directly, include the API key in the `Authorization` header:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript typescript
fetch('https://api.pineapple.ai/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer <PINEAPPLE_API_KEY>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'What is the meaning of life?' }],
  }),
});
```


```python python
import openai

openai.api_base = "https://api.pineapple.ai/v1"
openai.api_key = "<PINEAPPLE_API_KEY>"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="openai/gpt-4o",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello Pineapple!"}],
)

print(response.choices[0].message)
```


```shellscript shell
curl https://api.pineapple.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PINEAPPLE_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
  ]
}'
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  can add pineapple's dashboard and also check doc once, acc to openrouter
</Note>

### Key Security

<Warning>
  Always keep your Pineapple API keys private. If you suspect exposure, immediately delete the compromised key from [your dashboard](https://pineapple.ai/settings/keys) and create a new one.
</Warning>

Best practice: store keys in **environment variables**, not directly in code.
