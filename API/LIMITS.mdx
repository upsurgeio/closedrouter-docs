<Tip>
  Creating additional Pineapple accounts or API keys will not bypass rate limits, since capacity is governed globally. However, different models may have different rate limits - so you can distribute usage across them if needed.
</Tip>

### Rate Limits and Credits Remaining

To check the rate limit or credits left on your Pineapple API key, make a **GET** request to:

```bash
https://api.pineapple.ai/v1/key
```

<CodeGroup>

```typescript typescript
const response = await fetch('https://api.pineapple.ai/v1/key', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}',
  },
});
```


```python python
import requests, json

response = requests.get(
  url="https://api.pineapple.ai/v1/key",
  headers={ "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}" }
)

print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

</CodeGroup>

### Example Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "label": "Main Key",
    "usage": 120,          // Number of credits used
    "limit": 10000,        // Credit limit for the key (null if unlimited)
    "is_free_tier": false  // Whether this key is on the free tier
  }
}
```

### Notes

- **Free usage limits**: If using free-tier models, daily and per-minute request caps apply.
- **DDoS protection**: Abusive or excessive request bursts may be blocked.
- **Negative balance**: If your account balance is below zero, all requests (including free-tier) will fail until credits are added.
