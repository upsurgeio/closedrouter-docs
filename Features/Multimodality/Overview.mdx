Pineapple supports **multiple input modalities beyond text**, so you can send images, PDFs, and audio files to compatible models through the same `/chat/completions` endpoint.  This enables rich, multimodal interactions with minimal integration overhead.

### Supported Modalities

**Images**\
Send images to vision-enabled models for tasks like analysis, captioning, OCR, and visual Q&A.  Both **URL-based** and **base64-encoded** images are supported.\
[Read More about Image Inputs -\>](/Features/Multimodality/Images)

**PDFs**\
Process PDF documents seamlessly. Pineapple extracts text and handles both **text-based PDFs** and **scanned files**.  \
Accepted formats: **URL** or **base64-encoded**.\

**Audio (Not Yet Supported)**\
You can technically send audio in requests, but **Anthropic models do not process it**. No error will be thrown, it will simply be ignored. We recommend avoiding audio inputs for now until support is expanded.\

### Getting Started

All multimodal inputs use `/chat/completions` with the `messages` array.  \
Specify the content type for each input:

1. **Images** -\> `image_url`
2. **PDFs** -\> `file`
3. **Audio** -\> `audio`

You can combine multiple inputs in a single request. The maximum number of files depends on the model/provider.

### Model Compatibility

1. **Images** -\> Supported (URL \+ base64)
2. **PDFs** -\> Supported (URL \+ base64)
3. **Audio** -\> Ignored (no error, no output)

You can combine multiple modalities in a single request, and the number of files you can send varies by provider and model.

### Input Format Support

**URLs (Recommended for public content)**

1. Images: `https://example.com/image.jpg`
2. PDFs: `https://example.com/document.pdf`
3. Audio: ❌ Ignored

**Base64 Encoding (Required for local/private files)**

1. Images: `data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_data}`
2. PDFs: `data:application/pdf;base64,{base64_data}`
3. Audio: Ignored

<Note>
  URLs are preferred for large files since they avoid payload bloat.

  Use base64 encoding when working with local or private files.

### FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I send both images and PDFs in one request?">
    Yes. You can mix text, images, and PDFs in the same request. The model will process them together.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I send audio?">
    Audio inputs are accepted but not processed. You won’t see an error, but the model won’t respond to the audio content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will audio support be added later?">
    Yes, audio support is on the roadmap. Stay tuned for updates.
