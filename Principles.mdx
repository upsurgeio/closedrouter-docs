Pineapple is Bhindi’s in-house AI gateway that simplifies access to advanced models.  We believe the future of AI is **multi-modal, structured, and developer-first**.

### Why Pineapple?

**Unified API.** A single endpoint powers all features - structured outputs, multimodal inputs, tool calling, and more. No code rewrites when you switch models.

**Model Routing.** Pineapple intelligently routes requests across models for optimal performance, reliability, and cost efficiency - so your apps scale without friction.

**Structured Outputs.** Go beyond text: Pineapple natively supports schema-driven responses, making it easy to plug results directly into your apps and workflows.

**Multimodality.** Handle text, images, and beyond in one place. Pineapple is built to embrace the future of cross-modal AI.

**Developer Simplicity.** Bring your own API key or let Pineapple manage access. Transparent billing and standardized responses make integration painless.

**Resilience.** Smart fallback and automatic rerouting ensure your applications stay online, even when individual models experience downtime.

**Future-Proof.** Built on Bhindi’s agentic AI stack, Pineapple evolves alongside the ecosystem, so you always have access to the latest capabilities without code churn.
