Tired of juggling multiple API keys, SDKs, and docs just to work with different AI models?  You start with OpenAI, then Anthropic drops something new, and before you know it youâ€™ve got an entire zoo of configs and auth flows.  

**ClosedRouter** solves that.

We unify access to multiple LLM providers under **one simple API**.  

Think of it as your router to AI: send a request once, route it anywhere. \
No more scattered configs. No more copy-pasting tokens.  \
Just **one key** â†’ **all models**.

### Models

ClosedRouter currently supports the **top LLM providers** out of the box:  

1. **OpenAI** -\> GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5  
2. **Anthropic** -\> Claude 3 (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)  

Weâ€™re constantly adding more, so youâ€™ll always have the best models at your fingertips without changing your code.  

ðŸ’¡ You pick the model ID. We handle the rest.  

### âš¡ Quickstart

Authentication is **API Key only**.  \
Just add the following header to every request:

```bash
```
