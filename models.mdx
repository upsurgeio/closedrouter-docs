description: "ClosedRouter provides access to leading LLMs from OpenAI and Anthropic through a single unified API."
---

ClosedRouter gives you access to **two major model providers** under one API key:

-\> **OpenAI Models** : GPT family optimized for general-purpose reasoning, code generation, and structured outputs.\
-\> **Anthropic Models** : Claude family optimized for long context, safe alignment, and balanced reasoning.

### OpenAI Models

ClosedRouter supports the latest OpenAI models, including:

-\> **gpt-4** : High reasoning and creativity, useful for complex problem solving.  \
-\> **gpt-4o-mini** : Lightweight and cost-efficient version, suitable for fast responses.  

These models are accessed with the provider name `openai`.

### Anthropic Models

ClosedRouter also integrates **Anthropic Claude** models:

-\> **claude-3-sonnet** : Balanced tradeoff between performance and cost, suitable for most general tasks.  \
-\> **claude-3-opus** : Most capable Claude model, useful for deep reasoning and long-form analysis.  

These models are accessed with the provider name `anthropic`.

### Choosing the Right Model

-\> Use **OpenAI GPT-4** if you need structured outputs, coding help, or multi-turn conversations. \
-\> Use **Anthropic Claude** if you need safer outputs, longer context, or interpretability.  

### Example: Selecting a Model

You can directly pass the model ID when making a request:

```bash
curl https://api.closedrouter.io/v1/chat/completions \

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOSEDROUTER_API_KEY" \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  -d '{

    "model": "gpt-4",

    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Hello, world!"}]

  }'
```
